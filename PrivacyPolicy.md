# Privacy Policy

Last modified July 15, 2022

## 1. Why and how do you collect my data?

osu! dj (the "Service") mainly provides an automated application for chat and social platforms, mainly for Discord, and is operated by the osu! dj Team (the "Team", "we", "us") for users of the Service (“you”). This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with respect to information that is collected from users of the Service. Under applicable law, the osu! dj Team is the "data controller" of personal data collected throughout your usage of the Service.

## 2. What information do you collect?

When you interact with us through the Service, we may collect information from you, as further described below.

We collect information from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register for access to our Services. Information we collect may include but are not limited to:

**Chat data**: We store username and user id to aid you and others with using our Service. Including guild id and voice channel id.
**osu! data**: We store your osu! id to access your public osu! information in order to provide you with functionality such as your profile info and statistics.

osu! dj mainly gathers public data (but not save them) from the following sources:

-   osu! API
-   Discord API

## 3. Where is my data processed?

The Team is based in Brazil. No matter where you are located, you consent to the processing and transferring of your information in and to Brazil and other countries. The laws of Brazil and other countries governing data collection and use may not be as comprehensive or protective as the laws of the country where you live.

Our servers are located in the United States of America and Brazil.

## 4. What do you do with my data?

We use the information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide information for a certain reason, we may use the information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide information in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your information to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.

We use your data to:

(i) Monitor your compliance with our Terms of Service.
(ii) Allow you to persist and store data and settings.
(iii) Provide you with technology to enhance your experience with multiple services from osu! (Improving embeds for example.).
(iv) Provide you with technology that increases the quality-of-life experience in communities.
(vi) Comply with legal requirements.

We do not sell your data ever.

## 5. How long do you store data?

We only store Your Discord ID until you request the deletion of your data. We also don't store message logs as they're only cached and never saved to disk, ever.
The cached data lasts for a maximum of 30 days, but in reality it lasts for much shorter periods of time because the cache resets each time the bot is rebooted, which happens every few days because of the bot's continuous updates.

## 6. Can I request the deletion of my data?

Absolutely! Please e-mail us at sebola.email@gmail.com to request a deletion of all your stored data.
For server owners, you will have to remove the bot from your server before requesting data deletion for your server.

## Final

We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Service after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach us via email at sebola.email@gmail.com, or via [Discord](https://discord.gg/T6AJfnDHYP).
